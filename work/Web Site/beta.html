				Solitaire Universe has been ported to many devices recently, and
				we'd like to port to many many more. We need your help though.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you are willing to help please click
				<a
					href="http://groups.google.com/group/solitaire-universe-beta?hl=en"
					style="text-decoration: underline;"
				>here</a> to join our group.
			<p>

			<p>
				To join the beta group you will need to provide a list of
				devices that you have for testing.  We are looking for phones
				and tablets running android, webOS, blackberry OS and iOS.
			</p>

			<p>
				For each device please include the device model name, the OS and
				OS version that.
			</p>

			<p>
				You must be willing and able to do the following:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Install a package manually</li>

				<li>Take a screenshot</li>

				<li>Provide detailed descriptions of bugs</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				New builds will be posted for each device as they are ready.
