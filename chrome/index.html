				<h2>Yukon</h2>

				<h3>Goal</h3>

				<p>Move all cards to the foundations</p>

				<h3>Layout</h3>
				<p>
					Foundations are built up in suit from ace to king.  Cards
					can not be moved out of the foundations.<br/><br/>

					Tableaux are built up by alternating colors.
				</p>

				<h3>Rules</h3>
				<p>
					Any face up card can be moved from one tableau to another
					with all cards on top of it, even if they are not in
					sequence.  Only a king can be placed on an empty stack.
				</p>

				<h3>Variants</h3>
				<p>
					In Relaxed Yukon you are allowed to remove cards from the
					foundation.<br/><br/>

					Russian Solitaire is just like Yukon, except the tableaux
					build down by suit instead of alternating colors.<br/><br/>

					Alaska is just like Russian Solitaire, except the tableaux
					build up or down by suit.<br/><br/>

					Moose Hide is just like Yukon, except that the tableaux
					build down by any suit that does not match.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Spider</h2>
			<div>
				<h3>Goal</h3>
				<p>Move all cards to the foundations</p>

				<h3>Rules</h3>
				<p>
					54 cards are dealt from 2 decks to 10 tableaux, with the top
					card of each face up.  The remaining cards are left in the
					deck and placed in the top left corner.<br/><br/>

					Sequence in the tableaux can be built down by rank
					regardless of suit.  Cards may be moved as a sequence if
					they are all of the same suit.  An empty tableau may be
					filled with any card.<br/><br/>

					When a sequence of 13 cards of the same suit (from king to
					ace) is built it may be moved to a foundation.<br/><br/>

					Tapping on the deck will deal one card to each tableau.  If
					there are any empty tableaux then they must be filled before
					additional cards can be dealt form the deck.
				</p>

				<h3>Variants</h3>
				<p>
					In order to make the game easier it may be played with 1 or
					2 suits.  The total number of cards is not changed.
					<br/><br/>

					Spiderette uses the exact same rules, but with 1 deck and 7
					tableaux.  Each tableau is dealt one more card than the one
					before it.<br/><br/>

					Relaxed mode allows moving a stack of cards as long as they
					are all the same color.  Easy mode goes one step further and
					allows moving any stack of cards regardless of their color
					or suit.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Pyramid</h2>
			<div>
				<h3>Goal</h3>
				<p>
					Move all cards to the foundation in pairs that add up to 13.
				</p>

				<h3>Layout</h3>
				<p>
					The cards are dealt to the tableau in 7 rows, starting with
					a single card and increasing by one card for each row.  Each
					row overlaps the one before it, so only the cards in the
					last row can be used at the start of the game.<br/><br/>

					The remaining cards are left in the deck, and may be flipped
					one at a time to the waste.  The top card in the deck and
					the top card in the waste may be played at any time.
				</p>

				<h3>Rules</h3>
				<p>
					Drag any exposed card to another where the rank of the 2
					cards adds to a total of 13, and the 2 cards will be moved
					to the foundation.  Since a king has a value of 13 it can be
					placed in the foundation on it's own.
				</p>

				<h3>Variants</h3>
				<p>
					Double Pyramid uses 2 decks to make a pyramid with 9 rows.
					<br/><br/>

					In the relaxed variant a card can be dragged to one below
					it, if no other card overlaps it.  The relaxed variant only
					requires clearing the pyramid to win, instead of clearing
					all cards.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Klondike</h2>
			<div>
				<h3>Goal</h3>
				<p>Move all cards to the foundations</p>

				<h3>Layout</h3>
				<p>
					The 4 cells on the top right are the foundations.  28 cards
					are dealt to the tableaux, and the remaining cards are left
					in the deck and placed in the top left corner.
				</p>

				<h3>Rules</h3>
				<p>
					Sequences can be built in the tableaux by building down by
					alternate color.<br/><br/>

					An empty tableau may be filled with a king.<br/><br/>

					The foundations are built up, starting with ace in suit.
					<br/><br/>

					Tapping on the deck will flip a card and place it in a pile
					next to the deck called the waste.  The top card of the
					waste may be played on the foundations or the tableaux.
				</p>

				<h3>Variants</h3>
				<p>
					In draw 3 tapping on the deck will will deal 3 cards to the
					waste instead of just one.<br/><br/>

					In Thoughtful Klondike all cards dealt to the tableaux are
					face up.<br/><br/>

					Westcliff uses 10 tableaux, allows any card to be played on
					an emtpy space and does not allow any redeals.  Westcliff
					also prohibits moving cards out of the foundations.
					<br/><br/>

					Gypsy uses 2 decks, and 8 tableaux.  Any card may be played
					an empty space.  There is no waste in this game.  Instead
					tapping on the deck will deal one card to each of the
					tableaux.
				</p>

				<h3>Agnes Sorel</h3>
				<p>
					The Agnes Sorel variant uses the same layout as regular
					klondike, but does not have a waste.  Instead tapping on the
					deck deals one card to each of the tableaux.<br/><br/>

					When a new game is dealt one card is placed in the
					foundation and that card sets the starting rank for the
					game.  The first card placed on the 3 remaining foundations
					must match the rank of that card.<br/><br/>

					Cards in the tableaux build down by matching color instead
					of alternating color.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Golf</h2>
			<div>
				<h3>Goal</h3>
				<p>Move all cards to the waste</p>

				<h3>Rules</h3>
				<p>
					The game is started by dealing 35 cards to 7 tableaux, all
					face up.  The deck is placed in the top left corner, and one
					card is flipped to the waste.<br/><br/>

					The top card of any tableau may be played on the waste if
					it's rank is one above or below the rank of the top card in
					the waste.<br/><br/>

					Tapping on the deck will flip one card and play it on the
					waste.  This may be done repeatedly until the waste is
					empty.
				</p>

				<h3>Scoring</h3>
				<p>
					1 point is given for every card still in the tableaux.  If
					all cards are moved from the tableaux to the waste then a
					negative point is given for each card left in the deck.
					<br/><br/>

					A low score is good.  A score of 5 or under is considered a
					win.
				</p>

				<h3>Variants</h3>
				<p>
					Relaxed Golf allows cards to wrap, meaing that an ace may be
					played on a king, and a king may be played on an ace.
					<br/><br/>

					Dead King Golf does not allow any card to be played on a
					king.<br/><br/>

					Tri Peaks and Black Hole behave just like relaxed golf, but
					deal the cards in different layout.  In both of these
					variants a card can not be played when it is being partially
					covered by another card.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Gaps</h2>
			<div>
				<h3>Goal</h3>
				<p>
					Sort the cards into sets of 12 cards ascending by suit from
					2 to king.
				</p>

				<h3>Layout</h3>
				<p>
					The cards are shuffled, then dealt into 4 equal rows with 13
					cards each.  The aces are then removed leaving 4 gaps.
				</p>

				<h3>Rules</h3>
				<p>
					A card may be moved to a gap if it is the same suit and one
					greater in rank as the card to the left of the gap.  The
					left most card must be filled with a 2.<br/><br/>

					A gap can not be filled if it is to the right of a king
					because no card has a higher rank than a king.<br/><br/>

					When there are no moves remaining you may shuffle all cards
					that are not in sequence.  The gaps will be placed at the
					end of each row.

					You may shuffle 2 times.
				</p>

				<h3>Variants</h3>
				<p>
					Spaces is exactly the same as Gaps, except that the aces are
					are put back into the deck when reshuffling, and then
					removed again afterwards.  This leaves the gaps in random
					locations instead of being at the end of the row.

					Addiction is exactly the same as Spaces, except that it
					allows 3 shuffles instead of 2.<br/><br/>

					Spaces is exactly the same as Gaps, except that the gaps are
					placed randomly, making it more difficult.<br/><br/>

					Relaxed Gaps and Relaxed Spaces allow unlimited shuffles.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Freecell</h2>
			<div>
				<h3>Goal</h3>
				<p>Move all cards to the foundations</p>

				<h3>Layout</h3>
				<p>
					The playing field is split into 3 areas.  The 4 cells on the
					top left are the free cells that give the game it's name.
					The 4 cells on the top right are the foundations.  The rest
					are the tableaux.
				</p>

				<h3>Rules</h3>
				<p>
					The game is started by dealing one deck to the tableaux,
					with all cards face up.<br/><br/>

					Sequences can be built in the tableaux by building down by
					alternate color.  An empty tableau may be filled with any
					card.<br/><br/>

					Any one card may be placed in each free cell as a temporary
					storage area.<br/><br/>

					The foundations are built up, starting with ace in suit.
				</p>

				<h3>Moving Cards</h3>
				<p>
					The number of cards that can be moved as a sequence is
					limited by the number of empty tableaux and free cells.
					A sequence may only be moved if it is possible to perform
					the same move one card at a time.
				</p>

				<h3>Variants</h3>
				<p>
					Relaxed FreeCell removes the restriction on the number of
					cards that can be moved in a sequence to make the game
					easier.<br/><br/>

					Baker's Game is exactly like FreeCell, except that sequences
					in the tableaux are built in suit instead of by alternating
					colors.<br/><br/>

					Kings Only Baker's game is exactly like Baker's game except
					an empty tableau may only be filled by a king.<br/><br/>

					Seahaven Towers is exactly like Baker's game, but with 10
					tableaux.<br/><br/>

					ForeCell is exactly like FreeCell, except that the last four
					cards of the deck are dealt to the free cells, and an empty
					tableau may only be filled by a king.<br/><br/>

					Challenge FreeCell attempts to make the game more difficult
					by taking the aces and duces out of the deck before the
					shuffle and dealing them first.<br/><br/>

					Super Challenge FreeCell is exactly the same as Challenge
					FreeCell except that it also adds the rule that an empty
					tableau may only be filled by a king.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Canfield</h2>
			<div>
				<h3>Goal</h3>
				<p>Move all cards to the foundations</p>

				<h3>Layout</h3>
				<p>
					The game is started by dealing 13 cards to the reserve, 1
					card face up to each tableau, and 1 card to the foundation.
					The remaining cards are left in the deck.<br/><br/>

					The 1 card that was played to the foundation sets the
					starting rank for the game.  The first card played on the 3
					remaining foundations must match the rank of that card.
				</p>

				<h3>Rules</h3>
				<p>
					Sequences can be built in the tableaux by building down by
					alternate color.<br/><br/>

					The foundations are built up by suit.  The starting card is
					determined by the rank of the card that is automatically
					dealt to the foundation at the beginning of the game.
					<br/><br/>

					Tapping the deck will flip 3 cards and place them face up in
					a pile next to the deck called the waste.  The top card of
					the waste may be played on the foundations or the tableaux.
					<br/><br/>

					The 13 cards below the deck make up the reserve.  The top
					card of the reserve may be played to the foundations or the
					tableaux.
				</p>

				<h3>Scoring</h3>
				<p>
					The game is started by buying a deck for $52.  Ever card
					placed into the foundation earns you $5.  Since one card is
					automatically placed in the founcation when the game is
					dealt you begin each game with $-47.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Aces Up</h2>
				<h3>Goal</h3>
				<p>
					Discard as many cards as possible.  In a perfect game all
					cards except the aces will be discarded, thus the name.
				</p>

				<h3>Rules</h3>
				<p>
					The game is started by dealing 1 card face up to each of the
					4 tableaux.  The top card of a tableau may be discarded if
					it has a lower rank than another visible card of the same
					suit.<br/><br/>

					The top card of any tableau may be moved to any empty
					tableau.<br/><br/>

					Tapping on the deck will deal 1 card face up to each
					tableau.
				</p>

				<h3>Variants</h3>
				<p>
					In order to make the game easier it may be played with 2
					suits.  The total number of cards is not changed.<br/><br/>

					Aces Up 5 and Aces Up 6 add additional tableaux to make the
					game easier.
