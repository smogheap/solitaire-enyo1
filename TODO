+ Porting issues (issues that apply to all ports)
	- Menu option for leaving a review has a link to the webOS app catalog...

+ Resume support
	- Save state every x secons so that it can be resumed properly if the
	  browser or machine crashes.

+ Bugs
	- In tri-peaks after an undo it will sometimes still think there are no
	  playable cards.

	- Max aspect ratio doesn't work for gaps... no idea why...

	- Tapping on the deck in klondike doesn't always flip cards... Seen on the
	  playbook.

	- Detecting the closest stack only takes into account the bottom card in the
	  stack.

	- In tri-peaks some taps on the background are flipping the deck...

	- In tri-peaks cards may not always flip if they are also being highlighted
	  (Seen on the playbook)

	- Users like to double tap.... ignore a second tap within a specific time
	  period...

+ Issues for phones
	- What layout should be used for games like freecell? The free cells and
	  foundations on the sides? It is hard to get that right...

	- Should some games be left out of phone versions?

	- Most cardsets are not usable on phones. They should be disabled if the
	  screen size is too small. Brandon may provide additional small sets...

	- Card counters are too big when cards are very small

+ Feature Requests
	- "No playable moves" popup for games where it is possible, like klondike

	- Add a "pause" button

	- 40 Thieves
